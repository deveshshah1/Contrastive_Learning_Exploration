# Contrastive_Learning_Exploration
Exploring various methods of contrastive learning from SOTA literature. The key goal of this work is to explore various architectures and learning methods such as losses on a simple dataset/problem domain. 

In particular we use a similar problem as found in literature - face recognition and clustering. We will use a filtered version of the CelebA dataset.

Due to local compute limitations, this work is not trained using perfected hyper-parameters. But instead the focus is to notice the differences from our learning methods.
